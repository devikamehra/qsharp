To apply standard teleportation, entanglement pair should be brought back to $\ket{\Phi ^+}$. Correction with both `Z` and `X` gate can help achieve the transformation from $\ket{\Psi ^-}$ to $\ket{\Phi ^+}$.
- For 00, both Z and X correction is required.
- For 01, only X correction is required.
- For 10, only Z correction is required.
- For 11, no change is requried.
