To apply standard teleportation, entanglement pair should be brought back to $\ket{\Phi ^+}$. Correction with `Z` gate can help achieve the transformation from $\ket{\Phi ^-}$ to $\ket{\Phi ^+}$. 
- For 00, only Z correction is required.
- For 01, no change is required.
- For 10, both Z and X correction is required.
- For 11, only X correction is requried.
