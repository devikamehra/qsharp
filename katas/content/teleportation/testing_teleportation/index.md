**Goal:** 
Test that the `StandardTeleport` operation from previous exercise is able to successfully teleport the states 
$\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$, as well as superposition states such as $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0}+$\ket{1}$)$, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0}-$\ket{1}$)$, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0}+i$\ket{1}$)$ and $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0}-i$\ket{1}$)$.

**Note**:
TODO: If we choose to omit the verification (if we can), we can mention here about the task not getting covered by test case.
