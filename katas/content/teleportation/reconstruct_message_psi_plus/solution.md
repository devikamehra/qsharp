To apply standard teleportation, entanglement pair should be brought back to $\ket{\Phi ^+}$. Correction with `X` gate can help achieve the transformation from $\ket{\Psi ^+}$ to $\ket{\Phi ^+}$.
- For 00, only X correction is required.
- For 01, both Z and X correction is required.
- For 10, no change is required.
- For 11, only Z correction is requried.
